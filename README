Honestly, it what it sounds like.

It currently only supports a single method (getinfo) for subway systems (that I
know about) with actual web pages for individual stations.

    * Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)

    * Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)

    * New York Metropolitain Transportation Authority (MTA)

    * Société de transport de Montréal (STM)

    * Transport For London (TFL)

    * Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)

    * UK National Rail Service

    * Washington Metropolitain Area Transit Authority (WMATA)

Each service has an auto-generated "docs" page and there is support for fake
station web-pages, though the default is to issue a redirect to the
service-specific pages.

For example:

	http://fakesubwayapis.appspot.com/bart/ <-- docs 

	http://fakesubwayapis.appspot.com/bart/getinfo/16th <-- API

	http://fakesubwayapis.appspot.com/bart/station/16th <-- redirect

	http://fakesubwayapis.appspot.com/mta/station/550 <-- fake web page

# REQUIREMENTS

* A valid GAE account and a recent version of the GAE SDK for Python (>= 1.2.3)
  which can be downloaded from:

  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

There are two other dependencies which are not included as part of the package
itself. They are: 

* gae-APIApp

  http://github.com/straup/gae-APIApp/

* gae-fakesubwayapis-data

  http://github.com/straup/gae-fakesubwayapis-data/

They will need to be installed as follows:

 me @ localhost in /home/me/www/gae-fakesubwayapis

# NERD NOTES

There's a fair amount of boiler-plate code despite current refactoring
efforts. It would be nice to think that the only thing necessary to add a new
service would be a config/description file and have the code magically do the
right thing.

It seems a bit early for that still but, yes, I am thinking about
it. Suggestions are welcome.∂
